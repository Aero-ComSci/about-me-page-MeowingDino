</head>
<body>
    <h1 style="color:crimson; font-size: x-large">My Goals</h1>
    <p style="color: grey;">My name is Jason and I live in the United States of America, I was born in California Walnut Creek, and I now live in Dublin CA<br>
        I am currently in 9th grade in Emerald High Shcool and I have 1 brother a great mom and dad. <br>
        Throughout my high school career I hope to be able to maintain good grades so that I am able to major in something like Computer Science or Buisness.<br>
        To acheive my near impossible goal of being a succesful computer scientist I hope to score a good score in the SAT's which I will be taking in March 2024.<br>
        not only that but in the next 3 years I hope to be able to maintain a 3.7+ unweighted GPA. This will help me get into a dream college such as UC San Diego.<br>
        Not only will this make my parent proud, it will also make me a substantial amount of money which will hopefully allow me to retire before the age of 60, and will also let me move to somewhere like Lake Tahoe.<br></p>

        <h1 style="color: orange; font-size: x-large">My Accomplishments and Strengths </h1>
        <p style="color: grey;">Some of my best strengths are my unbreaking determination to acheive my goal, although I dont have the greatest mind in my head, I am very good at following thorugh with what I want or say I will do.<br>
        I think this makes me a very good worker as long as I am focused on something I beleive that I need to accomplish.<br>
    I also feel like I am a very detail     oriented person, this makes me able to pick out any errors or mistakes I can find. This can help me easily find discripancys in my work.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some of my greates accomplishments have happened in the past school year, I was able to get into a brand new High School, and although that was not my own doing, I feel like it is still something of a goal. <br>
    another accomplishment I have made in the past 5 months is learning so much from my classes, although sometimes I felt like my classes were a bit boring, I learnt a lot and was able to vastly improve my knowledge. <br>
    one accomplishment I was especially proud of was becoming more outgoing, near the start of 2023 I was like a snail in my shell. I felt the need to avoid as much contact with another human that I didnt know as mcuh as possible. <br>
    But thanks to some of my closest friends and and family I was able to creep out of my shell and make contact with others. This not only made me much happier, but this was also a very good life skill for the future. <br>
</p>
    <h1 style="color: yellowgreen; font-size: x-large">My Thanks</h1>
    <p>To wrap it all up I feel like I need to give you my thanks for reading all of this. I have droned on and on about my personal life, so I challenge you to find something about yourself that makes you so great and unique.<br>
    <br>
        Thanks you for reading 
        <br>-Sincerely Jason Z</p>
